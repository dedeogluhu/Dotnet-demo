#ShoppingDemo
A basic shopping site clone using various simple UIs

This is a project that i made to practice using databases and writing backend code so frontend-side maybe so much buggy

I don't plan anyone to use this but i am going to add tutorial to use and contribute for learners like me to see/criticize the app

#TODO:

- Adding WPF UI

- Adding Android UI

- Making Public

- Uploading mssql database codes

- steps to contribute and/or use if you want to use this bad app for some reason
